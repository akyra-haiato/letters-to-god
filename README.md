Letters to God - Indie Web-Game 

## The faith of the innocent is fragile, but honest - can you stand to watch it break?

Letters to God is a web-based game about innocence and faith. 

Before you, are seven letters, each showing the unravelling of a child's mind as their prayers are received with silence. 

When given power, how will you wield it?

Features: 

- Watch a heartbreaking narrative and make a final choice that can change everything; 

- 3 separate endings, each with their own hand-drawn cutscenes; 

- Short, but filled with mistery. Be careful to make an informed decision, you can't go back now.
